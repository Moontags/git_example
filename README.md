# Git Practice Project git_example

This is a practice project to demonstrate various Git functionalities, including branching, merging, stashing, and creating pull requests. The project includes simple text file modifications to showcase Git version control commands.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn and practice fundamental Git commands and workflows. By working through this project, the following concepts were explored:

- **Creating a repository**: Initialize a local Git repository.
- **Branching and merging**: Work on different branches and merge changes back into the main branch.
- **Git stash**: Temporarily store uncommitted changes and apply them later.
- **Tags**: Tagging specific commits for versioning.
- **Pull Requests**: Create a pull request for code review and merging.
- **Conflict resolution**: Resolve merge conflicts between branches.

## Key Git Commands Used

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Add files to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Commit changes with a message.
- `git checkout -b <branch>`: Create a new branch and switch to it.
- `git merge`: Merge changes from one branch to another.
- `git stash`: Temporarily save changes without committing.
- `git stash pop`: Apply stashed changes and remove them from the stash list.
- `git tag`: Create tags for specific commits.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Moontags/git_example.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd git_example
    ```

3. Checkout the main branch or create a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <new-branch>
    ```

4. Modify files, commit your changes, and practice Git workflows.
